 INTEGRATION
=============

Just call the following function to parse a tree.

Tree *Nez_parseTree(const char *inputs);

Example (in $cmd$.c) 

   Tree *t = Nez_parseTree("sometext");
   if(t != NULL) {
      Tree_dump(t);
   }

NOTE: This parser has no GC support for trees. 
Add some reference counting for trees.

=============
 QUICK START
=============
 
 make $cmd$ CFLAGS='-g -O3'
 ./$cmd$ <file> or <input-text>
 
Read the main function. You will know how to
integrate the parser into your programs.
